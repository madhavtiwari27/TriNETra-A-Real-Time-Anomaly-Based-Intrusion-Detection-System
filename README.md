# TriNETra: A Real-Time Anomaly Based Intrusion Detection System🛡️

**TriNETra** is an innovative, high-performance Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection System designed to monitor network traffic in real-time and proactively detect Denial of Service (DoS) and Probe attacks. It combines optimized machine learning (XGBoost/Decision Tree) with a novel **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** for feature selection and a dynamic **60-second sliding window** to ensure low-latency and highly sensitive detection.


## 💡 Key Features

- **Real-Time Packet Capture:** Utilizes _pyshark_ for continuous, high-speed capture and dissection of live network packets.
